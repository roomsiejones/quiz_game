## Details about project
<div>
When the start button is clicked, one of five questions with answer buttons display on the screen. 

When a question is answered, user is told if the response was correct or wrong 
and a new question is displayed along with its associated answers.

When a question is answered incorrectly, ten seconds are subtracted from the clock.

When all the questions are answered or the user runs out of time, the game is over. 

When the game is over, initials can be entered with the score and are saved locally to compare to other attempts or other students.
